## Log

### 20210720 Day87
Adjusted some of the model classes to accept data from the PATCH method. PUT and POST are working though  
Gotta troubleshoot this further...  

### 20210719 Day86
Predominantly writing scripts in the last couple years, I had forgotten most of the OOP concepts I learnt back in the day studying C++/Java  
So decided to brush up on Python specific OOP today  

### 20210716 Day85
Messed up big time rebasing a branch from upstream today. Lesson learned: you don't ALWAYS have to choose between incoming or existing code. We can just keep both and then trim manually  

Useful command for #git postmortems,  
$ git reflog show --date=iso

### 20210714 Day84
Trying to get POST, PATCH and PUT methods to work on an upstream API  
More good advice from my teammate: Breakdown the steps and troubleshoot as you go. It's better to overdo then delete, than to overthink and not do much. More code; less todos
