### 20210609 Day69 (Nice)
The api calls are working on Postman  
Seems like I'll need to write a Python script and use Requests to make the API call, then filter from this result  
I'm not really sure what to do with this filtered result.  
My senpai was talking about dynamic classes. Could be related, should ask  

### 20210608 Day68
Finalized scope and started building models from an existing templates file  
It's looking like an API wrapper imo  
There's a lot of data being returned from the big bad database  
We need to filter it down to what's needed in this project  
So the first thing would be to return all the data from the bigbaddb  
Then start filtering it down  


### 20210607 Day67
After a long (heart) break, finally started working on a new project at work.  
Repo ready, environment set, scope (not fully) defined, modeling tomorrow.
