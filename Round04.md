## Log

### 20210501 Day51
Mostly used [this article](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/install-openvpn-access-server-on-linux/) and the OpenVPN access server and client software to set it up  
It was only 20% more headache than I originally anticipated  
Keeping the details in my private logs for security purposes  


### 20210430 Day50
Chose Linode to setup my own VPN server  
Mostly read about the architecture and initiated the server
