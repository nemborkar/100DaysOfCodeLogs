# #100DaysOfCode Log - Nem Borkar

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 22, Sunday, 2021].

## Log

### 20210224 Day 03
Made a new repo for logs  

Now to continue with the todo app and front end side of things.  

Features to add,  
[Done] 1 - have a link on the main page to the todos page  
[Done] 2 - make sure there's a box/form over the add button to accept input;  
[Tomorrow] 3 - make sure this creates an object in the database  

Refamiliarized myself with the old project and chose some features to add. Almost started a deep dive into Django redirect() but looking at a sample project on stackoverflow, what I actually needed was a simple URL built-in template instead  

Link for Redirect deepdive: https://realpython.com/django-redirects/  
Might do that in tomorrow's study session  



### 20210223 Day 02
Spent 2 hours figuring out why my site on netlify couldn't clear fcc's tests and tinkering with github to register commits so the site gets updated  

Decided to just use the inbuilt IDE on fcc just to get things going; the curriculum could've just been a link to the docs  
It's too basic, the ratio of learning to time spent is poor, so dropping that curriculumin favour of articles and best practices docs  

I really don't think following a tutorial/curriculum is the way to go for this. Going back to my own projects (that will actually be useful in the new job) So I will study something for 1 hour and build it for the next. That's the new plan  


### 20210222 Day 01
Been already working on a simple Django app; putting that on hold.  
Starting with this [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance) course to write reliable code and improved tests.

Started the quality assurance curriculum on fcc  
Chose to use Netlify to deploy sites on  
Spent the hour configuring the Netlify CLI and test site  
Ran into some unknowns with build commands and publish directory but figured it out eventually  
Will actually get to work on the fcc JS tomorrow
