Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode  

Started working with a larger team on a real project today. Very excited with the new job! The CTO gave me a tour of the project. Got venv setup today and basically looked at the structure of the project.  

After trying to run the server, what I thought was a package version issues, turned out to be me working on the wrong branch lol. Learned about how to correctly read remote and local git branches.
[Essentially remotes/origin/main vs main, respectively]  

All in all a good day; learned a lot!  


### 20210228 Day 06
Yet another busy day and got home with just enough time to do the 1 hour of code  

Pulled objects from database to display on the main page  
Got HTTP POST to work  

Input is not being validated correctly and the form isn't saving.  
Will look into this tomorrow.  


### 20210227 Day 05
Couldn't do much yesterday and today was busy too but pushed through to finalize the database model and added forms. Really wanted to power through and get this done but need sleep and my 1 hour is out.  

Tomorrow, accept inputs on the HTML page and make sure the object is added all the way in the database  


### 20210225 Day 04 
Was low on motivation but managed to pull a pretty productive hour  
Project was lacking a base.html and got home.html to extend from it  

Explored bootstrap and my goodness, this simplifies SO MANY THINGS. The docs are super helpful with examples to work with. I wanna deep dive into this when I need to work on a more formal project. Just brilliant <3  

Gonna rethink the models tomorrow and add forms to actually add objects to the database  



### 20210224 Day 03
Made a new repo for logs  

Now to continue with the todo app and front end side of things.  

Features to add,  
- [x] 1 - have a link on the main page to the todos page  
- [x] 2 - make sure there's a box/form over the add button to accept input;  
[Tomorrow] 3 - make sure this creates an object in the database  

Refamiliarized myself with the old project and chose some features to add. Almost started a deep dive into Django redirect() but looking at a sample project on stackoverflow, what I actually needed was a simple URL built-in template instead  

Link for Redirect deepdive: https://realpython.com/django-redirects/  
Might do that in tomorrow's study session  



### 20210223 Day 02
Spent 2 hours figuring out why my site on netlify couldn't clear fcc's tests and tinkering with github to register commits so the site gets updated  

Decided to just use the inbuilt IDE on fcc just to get things going; the curriculum could've just been a link to the docs  
It's too basic, the ratio of learning to time spent is poor, so dropping that curriculumin favour of articles and best practices docs  

I really don't think following a tutorial/curriculum is the way to go for this. Going back to my own projects (that will actually be useful in the new job) So I will study something for 1 hour and build it for the next. That's the new plan  


### 20210222 Day 01
Been already working on a simple Django app; putting that on hold.  
Starting with this [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance) course to write reliable code and improved tests.

Started the quality assurance curriculum on fcc  
Chose to use Netlify to deploy sites on  
Spent the hour configuring the Netlify CLI and test site  
Ran into some unknowns with build commands and publish directory but figured it out eventually  
Will actually get to work on the fcc JS tomorrow
