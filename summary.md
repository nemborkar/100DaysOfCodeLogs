### 20210223 Day 02
Spent 2 hours figuring out why my site on netlify couldn't clear fcc's tests and tinkering with github to register commits so the site gets updated  

Decided to just use the inbuilt IDE on fcc just to get things going; the curriculum could've just been a link to the docs  
It's too basic, the ratio of learning to time spent is poor, so dropping that curriculumin favour of articles and best practices docs  

I really don't think following a tutorial/curriculum is the way to go for this. Going back to my own projects (that will actually be useful in the new job) So I will study something for 1 hour and build it for the next. That's the new plan  


### 20210222 Day 01
Been already working on a simple Django app; putting that on hold.  
Starting with this [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance) course to write reliable code and improved tests.

Started the quality assurance curriculum on fcc  
Chose to use Netlify to deploy sites on  
Spent the hour configuring the Netlify CLI and test site  
Ran into some unknowns with build commands and publish directory but figured it out eventually  
Will actually get to work on the fcc JS tomorrow
