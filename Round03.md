### 20210404 Day33

Installing djangorestframework globally on my machine solved yesterday's problem #DerpMoment  
Apparently, had installed it in the venv but not on my machine globally  

Finally finished writing the REST API in Django  
Will mess around with it and document the bare essentials tomorrow  


### 20210403 Day32

Trying to build APIs with Django REST framework and [this tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-first-rest-api-with-django-rest-framework-e394e39a482c)  
Can't seem to import from the rest_framework package into the myapp/serializer.py file for some reason. Even tried in a different IDE to no avail.  

Folks on the overflow say it could be an issue with the virtual environment... will try to recreate it tomorrow
