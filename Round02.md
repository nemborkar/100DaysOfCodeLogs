Most JP/KR IPs from my VPN provider are blacklisted at Starbucks  
Manila, Singapore, Mumbai worked though  
Then faced name server issues, so used #CloudFlare 1.1.1.1 DNS and getting successful pings back!  
TLS handshake is still failing, so gotta figure out a way around it  

Met the new client and the team is super friendly and very supportive!  
Turns out I'm leaning towards an IT consulting role  
Side note, started revisiting JavaScript from a Big O and DataStructure perspective  
Also looked at Kintone API and their limitations  
Apparently, Kintone has a different logo for Japan  
No idea why
