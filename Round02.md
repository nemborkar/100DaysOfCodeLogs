# #100DaysOfCode Round02 Log - Nem Borkar

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [February 22, Sunday, 2021].

## Log

### 20210322 Day24
Looked into OAuth 2.0 and considered building an authorization server  
Gotta get back into javascript, since we are gonna need it in the workplace soon  


### 20210319 Day23

Continued building stuff on #Kintone  
Nothing too crazy but messed around with lookups and events  

### 20210318 Day22
Built a small Dunder Mifflin paper ordering app on Kintone  
Understood how kintone workflows function; it's mostly Process Management (Status, Action, Assignee)
Also looked into Logiless and Asteria APIs. Logiless is fine because it simplifies ordering stuff on various sites but I'm not so sure about Asteria.  
Seems like a middleman pushing their way in...


### 20210317 Day21
Got the handover for the entire project from the senior engineer today  
Gonna build stuff with kintone tomorrow  
Looked into ways to combine APIs to limit API calls  
Also read about BCR (best conceivable runtime)
Gotta think and plan carefully before pitching a code-optimized solution to an org who has chosen a low code, no code solution  


### 20210316 Day20
Most JP/KR IPs from my VPN provider are blacklisted at Starbucks  
Manila, Singapore, Mumbai worked though  
Then faced name server issues, so used #CloudFlare 1.1.1.1 DNS and getting successful pings back!  
TLS handshake is still failing, so gotta figure out a way around it  

Met the new client and the team is super friendly and very supportive!  
Turns out I'm leaning towards an IT consulting role  
Side note, started revisiting JavaScript from a Big O and DataStructure perspective  
Also looked at Kintone API and their limitations  
Apparently, Kintone has a different logo for Japan  
No idea why
